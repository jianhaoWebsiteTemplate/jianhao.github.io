Hello, nice to meet you on my website. My name is Jianhao Zhu. I am an Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineer in gawkenergy LTD company. My research focuses on Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Process Intelligence. For AM, I primarily work on the generative design, process optimization, and material characterization for metal AM through laser powder bed fusion system (Renishaw AM400) to develop high-performance super alloys for aerospace and medical industries. For Process Intelligence, recognizing that metal printer training can be costly and complex, I am interested in advancing process intelligence as a human-centric knowledge system, one that empowers users by capturing expert knowledge and delivering it in a way that enhances learning, decision-making, and operational efficiency.
