Experience & Project
======
* Energy and Appliance Standards for Plug Loads: Assessing Current Needs and Future Opportunities:
This project primarily focuses on simulating device operations and analyzing data to provide recommendations for
California’s energy efficiency policies based on simulation protocols and standards. It also involves conducting basic
tests on plug load devices and developing reliable testing procedures to quantify energy usage across various operating
modes
* Workers and Technology Together (WATT): This project focuses on automating waste sorting by using machine
learning to classify different types of waste. A large labeled dataset of waste images is created to train the system,
enabling accurate and efficient waste segregation for improved recycling and sustainability. Increasing the volume of
labeled image data leads to improved classification accuracy. The model is trained to identify thirteen distinct waste
categories, such as cardboard, aluminum cans, and plastic bags
Service and leadership
* State Prediction and Energy Disaggregation using LSTM-Transformer Model for Sustainable
Manufacturing. This project focuses on predicting the next-second state based on previous time states, achieving an
accuracy of over 90%. It involves six devices, with data collection and analysis independently managed across two
related sub-projects. Based on the first data collection phase, the project analyzed time-series data to distinguish
between different temporal states at various timestamps and prepared the results for structured database storage.
* Additive Manufacturing of Aerospace Heat Exchanger: With extensive experience in metal printing,
particularly with aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel, currently focused on researching stainless steel 316 (SS316),
Haynes 282, and AlSi10Mg materials. I am currently engaged in a research project on AIMg10 metal powder recycling,
aiming to study the performance characteristics of metal powder after its initial use, followed by screening and detailed
analysis.
