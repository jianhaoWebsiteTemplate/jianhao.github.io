Nickel-based Haynes 282 superalloy is attracting more and more attentions for additively manufactured heat exchangers in the aerospace industry. Additively manufactured Haynes 282 has been investigated recently, but the systematic investigation of pulsed wave laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties remains missing. In this study, the exploration of processing parameters was conducted to fabricate fully dense Haynes 282 on L-PBF equipped with pulsed laser. The surface finish, microstructure, and mechanical properties of Haynes 282 were characterized through optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoindentation, and tensile test, respectively. The results demonstrate the successful fabrication of crack-free Haynes 282 using chessboard processing pattern, the porosity, surface finish, and mechanical properties are associated with both volumetric energy density and the overlap of laser, where porosity of 0.01% and surface roughness of 9.09 μm were achieved in the optimized specimen. Sub-grain structure and no carbides were observed in as-built Haynes 282, recrystallization and precipitation of γ′ (Ni3Al) were found after heat treatment, with carbides formed along with equiaxed and elongated grains. In as-built status, specimen has higher yield stress and ultimate tensile stress (UTS) in the XY plane, while higher engineering strain was observed in XZ plane. Increased YS and UTS were found in heat-treated samples, owing to the increased density of γ′ and carbides, with uniform elongation rates were found in XY and XZ planes, respectively. The relationship between processing parameters, microstructure, and properties was discussed.
